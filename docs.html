               <p>Heytherel You're looking at the docs for an Official Bootstrap Theme-thanks for your purchase! This theme has been lovingly crafted by Bootstrap's founders and friends to help you build awesome projects on the web. Let's dive in.</p>
               <p>Each theme is designed as it's own toolkit-a series of well designed, intuitlve, and cohesive components-built on top of Botstrap. If you've used Bootstrap itself, you'll find this all super familiar, but with new aesthetics, new components, beautifunl and extesive examples, and easy-to-ues build tools and documentation.</p>
               <p>Thanks, and enjoy!</p>
